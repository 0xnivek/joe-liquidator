# Joe Liquidator ðŸŒŠ

This repository is a liquidation bot built for [**Trader Joe**](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home), a 
DEX and lending service built on the [**Avalanche**](https://www.avax.network/) network.

It was built adhering to this [*Trader Joe Liquidation Bot Flash Loans Spec*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k8GusDAk-dLO8heNG-d4YJkmx8Z8vVMsIfS1R6QeMUE/edit).

## Structure

This repository is broken up into two main directories, `liquidator` and `liquidator-bot`

### `liquidator`

This directory contains all relevant smart contracts. The main one is `liquidator/contracts/JoeLiquidator.sol`
which contains an external `liquidate` function:

```solidity
contract JoeLiquidator {
  function liquidate(
      address _borrowerToLiquidate,
      address _jRepayTokenAddress,
      address _jSeizeTokenAddress
  ) external;
}
```

To learn more, see [Liquidation](#liquidation).

### `liquidator-bot`

This directory contains a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) project which is what continously
searches for liquidatable accounts and calls our `JoeLiquidator` contract periodically.

## Setup

The only setup required is to make a copy of `liquidator-bot/env.template` and rename it to
`liquidator-bot/.env`.

In this file, insert the private key of the wallet address you would like to use to perform
liquidation for the `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` environnment variable.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kevinchan159/joe-liquidator.git
cd joe-liquidator/liquidator
yarn install
cd ../liquidator-bot
yarn install
```

## Building

To compile the smart contracts:

```
cd liquidator
yarn compile
```

To run the bot:

```
cd liquidator-bot
yarn start
```

## Testing

The smart contract tests are defined under the [liquidator/test](https://github.com/kevinchan159/joe-liquidator/tree/main/liquidator/test) directory. To run them:

```
cd liquidator
yarn test
```

## Liquidation

Liquidation is possible when an account is incurring a shortfall, i.e. their total borrow balance exceeds their total
collateral balance. To prevent the potential losses, the protocol exposes a public `liquidateBorrow/liquidateBorrowNative` 
function that can be called by anyone to "liquidate" an underwater account.

Liquidation itself is the process of selling a portion of the underwater account's collateral at a discounted rate, i.e.
the *liquidation incentive*, to a liquidator in exchange for the liquidator repaying an equivalent amount of the underwater
account's borrow position. The maximum amount of collateral that can be sold to the liquidator is determined by the *close factor*.

Specifically, *Joe Liquidator* performs liquidation using [**flash loans**](#flash-loans). The algorithm followed for liquidation
is as follows:
